# PlantUML Diagram Generation Instructions

## What is PlantUML?

PlantUML is an open-source tool that allows you to create UML diagrams from a text-based description language. This is helpful for maintaining diagrams as code and keeping them updated with your project.

## How to Generate the Diagram

There are several ways to generate the diagram from the PlantUML file:

### Option 1: Online PlantUML Server

1. Go to [PlantUML Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
2. Copy and paste the contents of `diagrams/DailyMoodTracker_ClassDiagram.puml` into the text area
3. The diagram will be rendered automatically on the right side
4. You can download the image in various formats (PNG, SVG, etc.)

### Option 2: Use the PlantUML Plugin for Your IDE

If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code, you can install a PlantUML plugin:

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Install the "PlantUML integration" plugin from the marketplace
- **Eclipse**: Install the "PlantUML Eclipse Plugin"
- **Visual Studio Code**: Install the "PlantUML" extension

After installing the plugin, you can usually open the .puml file and see a preview or render the diagram directly.

### Option 3: Command Line

1. Download PlantUML jar from [PlantUML website](https://plantuml.com/download)
2. Run the following command:

```bash
java -jar plantuml.jar diagrams/DailyMoodTracker_ClassDiagram.puml
```

This will generate an image file in the same directory as your .puml file.

## Understanding the Class Diagram

The class diagram represents the structure of the Daily Mood Tracker application:

- **Model Classes**: These define the data structures used in the application (User, MoodEntry, Goal, etc.)
- **Service Classes**: These provide business logic and operations on the models
- **Repository Classes**: These handle data persistence operations
- **Controller Classes**: These connect the UI with the services and models

The lines between classes represent different types of relationships:
- Solid lines with arrows show associations and dependencies
- Lines with diamonds show composition/aggregation
- Dashed lines show implementations of interfaces

## Customizing the Diagram

If you need to customize the appearance of the diagram, you can modify the style definitions at the top of the .puml file. For example, you can change colors, fonts, and other visual properties.
